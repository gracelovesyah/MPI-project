# MPI-project

This repo demonstrates the coding and report for our  arallel computing project. 

In this project, our team implemented parallel computing on social media analysis through the University of Melbourne High Performance Computing (HPC) facility SPARTAN. This report will demonstrate the invoking procedure and code parallelising approach of our application. Additionally, it will introduce the data analysis algorithm and relevant assumptions. Moreover, this report will describe the performance variations on different numbers of nodes and discuss the potential reasons and limitations.
